## Introduction
AdGass is a groundbreaking project that aims to revolutionize the crypto transaction experience by offsetting gas fees through advertising revenue. We understand the frustration of paying gas fees, which often hinder the seamless utilization of blockchain networks blocking mass adoption. By integrating ads into the transaction process, AdGass enables users to significantly reduce or eliminate their  gas costs, making crypto transactions more affordable and accessible.

## Problem Statement
The high costs associated with gas fees have been a constant pain point for crypto users. While some efforts have been made to reduce gas costs, the problem persists. Millions of users across various blockchain networks face the burden of verifying transactions and paying substantial fees for everyday actions within the ecosystem. These costs often discourage participation and limit the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies.

## Proposed Solution
At AdGass, we propose a novel and practical solution to the gas fee problem. Instead of solely focusing on reducing gas costs, we introduce a unique concept where watching ads becomes a means to offset gas fees on 90% of transactions. We leverage the fact that advertisers are willing to pay between $0.3 - $0.5 USD per viewer. This means that the majority of your crypto transactions can be made for free or at a significantly reduced cost by engaging with sponsored content.

## Demo
We invite you to watch our video demo, showcasing a user seamlessly watching a sponsored ad and having the gas cost for a specific transaction, such as staking or sending tokens, fully offset. Witness firsthand the power of ad revenue in fueling your transactions and eliminating the barrier of constant gas fees.

## AdSence for Web3
AdGass is not just another project; we are building AdSence for Web3, targeting a +$100B industry that is currently broken. While traditional online advertising revolutionized the Web 2 landscape, Web 3 demands a fresh approach. By integrating ads directly into blockchain transactions, we pave the way for a sustainable and user-centric advertising model. Our mission is to increase adoption and drive the growth of the entire Web 3 ecosystem by removing the pain points associated with gas fees.

## Business Model
Our business model is designed to ensure a win-win situation for users, advertisers, and the AdGass platform. We generate revenue by taking a percentage of what companies are willing to pay per viewer of an ad. Advertisers benefit from direct access to a highly engaged audience, while users enjoy reduced or eliminated gas fees. This sustainable approach supports the growth and maintenance of our platform while prioritizing user experience and accessibility.

## Why AdGass
AdGass aligns with the global movement towards Web 3, where decentralized technologies and cryptocurrencies are gaining traction. The current landscape presents an opportune moment for introducing our solution. With advancements in blockchain technology, such as account abstractions, the majority of gas costs have become small enough to offset with ad revenue. AdGass aims to capitalize on this shift and drive widespread adoption by providing a seamless, cost-effective, and user-friendly experience for crypto transactions.

## Team
Our team is composed of highly skilled individuals who bring expertise in various areas, enabling us to deliver a robust and impactful solution. With our project lead, who has spent years managing devoloper realtions in web3 targeting major sponsors and early adopters, and our talented full-stack developers, we possess the necessary knowledge and experience to drive this project forward. Additionally, our growth leader, who has led successful initiatives in the AI industry, ensures a strategic approach to scaling our user base and securing partnerships.

## Sponsors and Waiting List
During this event, we had the opportunity to engage with numerous sponsors who expressed great interest in partnering with us upon our launch. We have curated a waiting list consisting of some of the biggest companies eager to leverage our platform's capabilities. AdGass enables businesses to target users based on wallet activity, opening up new avenues for personalized advertising in the crypto space.
